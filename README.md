# Wave Turbulence Enhancement and Mixing

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wave breaking enhance surface turbulence in ocean, coastal, and estuaries. Using coupled FVCOM-SWAVE-GOTM model and instrumental observation in Long Island Sound these phenomena is simulated and the effects on vertical mixing in western Long Island Sound reviewed. Western Long Island Sound encountered with hypoxia during summer. Studying these phenomena would help to manage this unfavorable condition in western Long Island Sound.
